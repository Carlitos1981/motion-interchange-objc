## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

> CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift libraries. CocoaPods automates the
> process of using third-party libraries in your projects. See
> [the Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for more
> information. You can install it with the following command:
>
>     gem install cocoapods

Add `MotionInterchange` to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'MotionInterchange'

Then run the following command:

    pod install

### Usage

Import the framework:

    @import MotionInterchange;

You will now have access to all of the APIs.

## Example apps/unit tests
